3.Inserting values in tables
4.Using the COPY statement to upload the data from a csv file to table
5.Select query
6.WHERE Statement
7.Inner and Left Joins
8.Sub query
9.CTE
10. CASE WHEN statements
11.RANK function
12.Group By, Having, Order By statements
13.Aggregate functions like sum, count
14.Extract function

The queries are also attached.
Additionally, I have also created some charts and dashboards using Metabase to have a better look at the insights.
