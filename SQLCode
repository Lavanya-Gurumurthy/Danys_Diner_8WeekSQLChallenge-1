##Creating a database:

CREATE DATABASE danys_diner;

##Creating Tables:

#Menu Table

CREATE TABLE menu (
product_id integer primary key,
product_name varchar(10) NOT NULL,
price integer NOT NULL);

#Sales Table

CREATE TABLE sales (
customer_id varchar(1) NOT NULL,
order_date date,
product_id integer REFERENCES menu(product_id));

#Members Table

join_date timestamp);

Inserting Data:

Insert into members VALUES ('A','2021-01-07'), ('B','2021-01-09');

Insert into menu VALUES (1,'sushi',10), (2,'curry',15), (3,'ramen',12);

Case Study Questions:
Below, you can find the case study questions and the SQL Query to get the result.

1.What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
select s.customer_id, sum(m.price) AS amount_spent from sales s inner join menu m ON s.product_id=m.product_id GROUP BY s.customer_id;

2.How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
select customer_id, count(distinct(order_date)) from sales group by customer_id;

from sales s inner join menu m on s.product_id=m.product_id) AS sub
WHERE r1=1;

4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
Overall most purchased product 
 select m.product_name, count(s.product_id) as cnt from sales s inner join menu m on 
 m.product_id=s.product_id 
 group by m.product_name;
 
No of times all the items were purchased by customers 
select s.customer_id, m.product_name, count(s.product_id) as cnt from sales s 
 inner join menu m on m.product_id=s.product_id
 group by s.customer_id, m.product_name order by s.customer_id, cnt desc;
 
 Number of times Ramen alone was purchased by each customer:
  select s.customer_id, m.product_name, count(s.product_id) as cnt from sales s 
 inner join menu m on m.product_id=s.product_id
 WHERE m.product_name='ramen'
 group by s.customer_id, m.product_name order by s.customer_id, cnt desc;

5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
select sales.customer_id,sales.product_id,menu.product_name, count(sales.product_id) as cnt from sales inner join menu on sales.product_id=menu.product_id group by sales.customer_id, sales.product_id,menu.product_name order by customer_id, cnt desc;

6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
select sub1.customer_id, sub1.product_name, sub1.order_date, sub1.join_date, sub1.rank1 from 
(select s.customer_id, m.product_name, s.order_date, me.join_date, 
RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER By s.order_date) AS rank1
from sales s 
inner join menu m on s.product_id=m.product_id 
inner join members me on me.customer_id=s.customer_id 
where order_date>join_date) AS sub1
where sub1.rank1=1;

7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
select sub1.customer_id, sub1.order_date, sub1.product_name, sub1.join_date from
(select s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, me.join_date,
rank () over (partition by s.customer_id order by s.order_date desc) as r1
from sales s 
inner join menu m on s.product_id=m.product_id 
inner join members me on s.customer_id=me.customer_id 
where s.order_date<me.join_date) AS sub1
where sub1.r1=1;

8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
select sub1.customer_id, count(*) AS No_items, sum(sub1.price) AS Amount from
(select s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, me.join_date, m.price
from sales s 
inner join menu m on s.product_id=m.product_id 
inner join members me on s.customer_id=me.customer_id 
where s.order_date<me.join_date) AS sub1 
GROUP BY sub1.customer_id 
ORDER BY sub1.customer_id;

9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

select sub1.customer_id, sum(sub1.points) AS total_points from 
(select s.customer_id, m.product_name, m.price, (CASE WHEN product_name='sushi' THEN (price*20) ELSE (price*10) END) AS points 
from sales s inner join menu m on s.product_id=m.product_id) AS sub1
GROUP BY customer_id 
ORDER BY customer_id;

10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

SELECT sub2.customer_id, extract(month from sub2.order_date) AS order_month, SUM(sub2.points) FROM
(SELECT sub1.customer_id, sub1.order_date, sub1.join_date, sub1.diff_dt, sub1.product_name, sub1.price,
(CASE WHEN ((sub1.diff_dt>=0 AND sub1.diff_dt<7) OR (sub1.product_name='sushi')) THEN (price*20) ELSE (price*10) END) AS points
FROM
(select s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.join_date, 
EXTRACT(day from s.order_date) AS order_dt_value, 
extract(day from m.join_date) AS join_dt_value, 
(EXTRACT(day from s.order_date)-extract(day from m.join_date)) AS diff_dt,
me.product_name, me.price
from sales s inner join members m on s.customer_id=m.customer_id
inner join menu me on s.product_id=me.product_id) AS sub1) AS sub2
GROUP BY sub2.customer_id, order_month
having extract(month from sub2.order_date)=1;

Bonus questions:
1.Join all the tables

SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price,
(CASE WHEN ((me.join_date IS NULL) OR (s.order_date<me.join_date))THEN 'N' ELSE 'Y' END) AS Member
FROM sales s INNER JOIN menu m ON s.product_id=m.product_id LEFT JOIN members me ON s.customer_id=me.customer_id;


2. Ranking of products - Rankings are only from members

with ranks AS (SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price,
(CASE WHEN ((me.join_date IS NULL) OR (s.order_date<me.join_date))THEN 'N' ELSE 'Y' END) AS Member
FROM sales s INNER JOIN menu m ON s.product_id=m.product_id LEFT JOIN members me ON s.customer_id=me.customer_id)

select *,
(CASE WHEN member='N' THEN null
ELSE RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, member ORDER BY order_date) END) AS Ranking
FROM ranks;
